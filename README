This is an inital work on UNIRAST CUPS filter

The urftopdf.c program is a simple CUPS filter which decodes an UNIRAST file to a PDF file.
It does not handle the Colorspace/Duplex Mode/Quality informations.
It depends on the libharu 2.2.1 and libcups.

Thanks for http://alanQuatermain.net/ for its URF file partial decode.
